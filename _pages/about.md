I'm a Lecturer in Computer Science at Aston University/UK, where I'm currently in charge of teaching Data Mining and Data Science Programming (Python and R - yay!).

### Some History
My path to data science is slightly convoluted: after graduating as an Electrical Engineer from UFMG/Brazil (2003), I was awarded a _Monbusho_ scholarship from the Japanese government to pursue my postgraduate studies under the supervision of Prof. Hajime Igarashi at Hokkaido University, Japan. I earned my M.Sc. in Information Science and Technology (2006), and later my Ph.D. in Systems Science and Informatics (2009), working on the development and application of computational intelligence approaches for the optimisation of electromagnetic systems. 

I went back to Brazil in 2009 as a post-doctoral fellow, and in 2010 I joined UFMG's Department of Electrical Engineering as an Assistant Professor in Optimisation and Computational Intelligence. While at UFMG I started becoming progressively more interested in statistical inference, and then in statistical modelling and data analysis, which eventually brought me to working with the development of solution pipelines that seamlessly integrate data mining, optimisation and multi-criterion decision making for the solution of a variety of problems in science and engineering. That, of course, requires a lot of what is commonly referred to as _Data Science_: understanding a problem domain, investigating and engineering features, devising the most adequate modelling strategy, etc.. 

After I joined Aston University in early 2019, I continued to work in this general area, expanding my interests to the analysis of biological signals and sequences, as well as educational data.
