What kind of dark magic is this?

This is me, back in August 2006. At that particular moment I was climbing down Mount Fuji. On an impulse I decided to call my dad - who was literally (within reasonable error bounds) on the other side of Earth, to tell him I had just watched a beautiful sunrise from the top of Japan's highest mountain. 

The most amazing thing in this picture is not my personal achievement - many 70+ Japanese ladies did the climb on that night, so it was no big feat of my youthful vigour. What really makes me stop and wonder endlessly is that we take it for granted that you can communicate, instantly, with essentially anyone you know on the planet, almost for free. I could do that back in 2006. Today I'd probably be able to stream HD video. Real magic (at least in the sense of [Arthur C. Clarke's third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws)).

I still remember growing up in Brazil back in the 1980's / early 90's, where a landline telephone number was as expensive as a car. One of my dreams in my early teens was to be able to listen to my favorite radio songs whenever I wanted ([Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster) was still a few years away). Assuming we're not about to witness the end of our technological civilisation, I wonder what magic the next decade is going to unveil.
