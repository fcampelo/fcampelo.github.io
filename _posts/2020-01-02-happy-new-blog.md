This is my fifth attempt at blogging. So what?

***

The first and most successful one was a diary that I kept between 2004 and 2009, while I was living in Japan. It was originally intended at providing friends and family back in Brazil with regular updates about my life, in a time before Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter. It worked, but lost its _raison d'etre_ after I went back to Brazil at the end of my PhD. 

I tried to turn it into a science blog (attempt #2), which I maintained for about a year. Some of my texts on that blog ended up being picked up and reposted in the Brazilian science communication (+ scepticism) online ecosystem, but I closed up shop after months of inactivity (I had too many other things in my mind at the time, including trying to understand how a newborn daughter worked). 

The third and fourth attempts were pathetically brief contributions to Brazilian collaborative blogs on science communication. Epic fail and a massive waste of everyone's time.

**So, why try again?**
Because I want to. I'm always thinking and reading about amazingly interesting stuff related to (data and "non-data") science, and I want to be able to write about it sometimes. I quit Facebook years ago, and Twitter is just getting me angry these days, so a personal blog may provide me with a safe(r) haven to deposit my ramblings. It may also give me a reason to practice writing about science for a general audience, which I haven't really done in a long while.

**Why in English?**
Because I want to. I may eventually start to blog in Portuguese again, but since I now live and work in the UK it felt right. Plus, it gives me a reason to improve my writing. :)

Well, that's it for now. Let's see how far this goes - wish me luck! :)
